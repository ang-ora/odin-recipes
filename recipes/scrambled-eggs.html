      <h3>ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium non-stick pan over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and whisk until well blended.</li>
        <li>
            When the butter begins to bubble, pour in the eggs and immediately use 
            a silicone spatula to swirl in small circles around the pan, without 
            stopping, until the eggs look slightly thickened and very small curds begin 
            to form, about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Change from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger, creamy curds; about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>
            When the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places, remove the pan 
            from the heat and leave for a few seconds to finish cooking. Give a final 
            stir and serve immediately. Serve with an extra sprinkle of salt, a grind of 
            black pepper and a few fresh chopped herbs (if desired).
        </li>
      </ol>
